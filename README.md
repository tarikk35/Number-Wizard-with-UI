# Unity Number Wizard With User Interface


Hello, I remade Number Wizard with fun images, sounds and animated images.
 In my version, Gandalf is the main character and I added some jokes and built my game around it. You should try it out !




Game lets you choose any number as minimum number and any maximum number bigger than the minimum number you have picked before . Then , game tries to randomly guess your number  between minimum and maximum number.
This game includes a very simple anti-cheating system . So be honest with your answers :)
**I do not own any of the images, sounds or the idea of the game that made.**
